The project documentation is generated automatically through a continuous integration workflow implemented using a GitHub Action (\autoref{ap:github}). This workflow executes the Doxygen engine, which extracts structured information directly from the annotated comments within the source code. By following Doxygen's documentation conventions, each module, function, and data structure is described where it is implemented, ensuring that the documentation remains consistent with the evolving codebase.

Whenever new commits are pushed to the repository, the GitHub Action is triggered, automatically regenerating the documentation and preventing discrepancies between the implementation and its technical description. As part of the same workflow, the generated documentation is automatically deployed to a GitHub Pages site, making it accessible online without requiring manual intervention.

The documentation can be accessed directly through the following link: \url{https://estelamb.github.io/NEST_ASP/}.
