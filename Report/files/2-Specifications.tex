    \begin{tabular}{p{0.25\textwidth}p{0.7\textwidth}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Description} \\ 
        \midrule
        Hybrid Deployment & Implementation must work with a subset of real physical elements in parallel with simulated parts. \\
        Sensing and Actuation & The network must contain both sensors and actuators to interact with the environment. \\
        Periodic Sensing & The system must perform periodic measurements of at least two different types. \\
        Node Infrastructure & Network intelligence must be deployed directly in the nodes to support Edge computing. \\
        Commanding & Network elements must be capable of receiving and executing tasks commanded from the server side. \\

\subsection{Software Requirements}
The software layer is defined by the engineering standards and communication protocols required for a level \gls{IoT} application.

        \toprule
        \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Requirement / Specification} \\ 
        \midrule
        Development Process & Sequential Waterfall model: requirements analysis, architectural design, detailed design, implementation, and testing. \\
        Standard Modeling & Full utilization of \gls{UML} for all design and modeling phases. \\
        Communication Stack & Support for standard transport protocols (primarily \gls{MQTT}) and \gls{JSON} data formats. \\
        Visualization & Custom dashboards for historical trend analysis and real-time telemetry visualization. \\
        Software Deliverables & Mandatory submission of source code and complete documentation. \\
        \bottomrule
