\subsection{Project Documentation}

The technical documentation is structured using the \textbf{Sphinx} documentation generator. Sphinx provides a flexible and professional layout, leveraging reStructuredText to seamlessly integrate high-level project descriptions with detailed \gls{API} technical specifications.

The documentation process is fully automated through a \gls{CI} workflow powered by GitHub Actions. This pipeline executes the Sphinx engine to extract structured information directly from source code docstrings and comments.

Upon every push to the repository, the GitHub Action triggers to regenerate the \gls{HTML} files and automatically host them via GitHub Pages. This automation eliminates discrepancies between the current software version and its public documentation, ensuring the manual is updated without the need for manual intervention.

The documentation is available at the following URL: \url{https://estelamb.github.io/NEST_ASP/}.
